#Sprint 6 Retrospective
###What went well?
* Automated building, testing, and releasing
* Code being refactored to enable testability

###What didn't go well?
* Stakeholders are shocked at having so many new releases to review
* Stakeholders contradicted each other with their needs
* Technical debt is slowing down our ability to innovate

###What will we do to improve?
